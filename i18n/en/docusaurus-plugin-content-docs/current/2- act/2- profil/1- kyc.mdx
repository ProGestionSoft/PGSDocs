Congratulations! You have successfully created an account on **PRO GESTION SOFT** and can now access it.

To ensure the authenticity of the provided information and the security of your account, KYC (Know Your Customer) verification is required. This process validates your identity and your company’s legal information.

## Why KYC verification? \{#why}
The purpose of KYC verification is to protect users by ensuring that each account belongs to a verified and authentic entity. This step not only complies with legal requirements but also secures the platform by restricting access to authenticated users only. Thus, KYC verification is essential to gain full and secure access to the advanced features of Pro Gestion Soft.

## Account verification process \{#process}
We will assist you in verifying your account through a few simple steps and monitoring the verification status.

### Steps to verify your account \{#step}
:::warning 
You can submit a KYC verification request ***only once every 30 days***. Make sure all documents provided are up-to-date and legitimate, and that the information is accurate.
:::

To complete your account verification, please follow these detailed steps:

- Log in to your account.
- In the top-right corner of your interface, click on the profile icon <i class="fas fa-user-circle"></i> (or your profile picture if you’ve already changed it at least once) to open the dropdown menu.
- Select " **Expand** " to access your Profile Space.
- Navigate to the **DOCUMENTS** section where you can initiate the verification process. You will see fields for the required information and documents, including:
    - *[Tax ID Document](/docs/intro#terminology)*: Upload a copy of your Tax Identification Number (IFU), which identifies your company for tax purposes.
    - *[Business Registration Certificate](/docs/intro#terminology)*: A copy of your business registration certificate, proving the legal existence of your company.
    - *Manager's ID*: This document validates the identity of the account’s responsible person.
- Once the information and documents are provided, click Save to submit your details.

:::tip Tips for document validation
- ***Ensure document quality***: Submitted documents must be perfectly legible. Avoid blurry, cropped, or poorly framed photos, as these may delay validation. Prefer clear scans or sharp photographs, ensuring that all important details are visible.
- ***Check file size and format***: Files must be in PDF, JPEG, or PNG format, with a maximum size of 5 MB per document. Ensure the file format is correct to avoid upload failures.
- ***Keep information up to date***: In case of a change in management or updated company documents, it’s important to submit recent versions. Keeping your account compliant avoids any restrictions.

### Tracking verification status \{#tracking}
> KYC verification may take between 24 and 72 hours. Once approved, you will receive a confirmation email.

After submitting your documents, we will review your information and send you an email notification confirming that the verification is in progress.

You can track the status of your verification by returning to the DOCUMENTS section in your profile.

:::note
- ***Data confidentiality***: All documents submitted for KYC verification are strictly confidential. Pro Gestion Soft adheres to a strict privacy policy, and no document will be shared with third parties without your consent.
- ***Account security***: This step is crucial to ensure the security and validity of your account. Without KYC verification, access to certain platform features may be restricted or suspended.
