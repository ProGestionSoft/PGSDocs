We understand the importance of having accurate and up-to-date profiles, whether for the main user or the company. We allow you to easily update your personal and business information at any time, ensuring that your profile accurately reflects your identity and company details.

## Why update your profile? \{#why}
Regularly updating your profile ensures the accuracy of information, which can be crucial for certain operations or for verifying your identity. It also helps your collaborators, partners, or contacts to have up-to-date data.

In cases of incorrect entries during registration, new contact information, or an update to the company's trade name, it is essential to reflect these changes in your profile.

## How to update your profile? \{#how}
- Log in to your account.
- Click on the profile icon in the top-right corner of your interface to access the profile menu.
- Select "Expand" to access the "GENERAL" section of your Profile Space, where all the main account-related information is centralized. In this section, you can update your personal or business information.

### Update your yersonal yrofile \{#pers-edit}
Here you can update important information such as your **first and last name**, your **date and place of birth**, or your **profile picture**.

To make these changes, click on the **Edit Your Info** button. Once the information is updated, save the changes to make them effective.

### Update your business profile \{#prof-edit}
Details about your company, such as the **trade name**, **logo**, and **business contact information**, can also be adjusted to reflect your company's evolution.

:::note
- ***Trade name***: You can update your company's trade name to reflect any administrative changes. *This update, however, is limited to once every 30 days to maintain profile consistency.*
- ***Company logo***: To enhance your company's visual identity, you can add or update the logo. *This logo is visible to you and can be made public during recruitment processes.*
:::

To make these changes, click on **Switch to edit mode** in the company information section. This will enable the text fields and options needed to update your company's details. Once the changes are made, make sure to save them.

To update your email address, scroll down the section to find the <span className={styles.editMail}>Edit email address</span> button. Follow the instructions to enter your new address. Once this operation is validated, a confirmation email will be sent to verify your new address.

### Managing profile pictures and company logos \{#logos}

:::warning
You can change your profile picture and company logo at any time, and as often as you like. However, it is important to note that once an image is set, it cannot be deleted, only replaced with a new one. Therefore, make sure to select representative and high-quality images.
:::

Your personal profile and company profile are represented by distinct images:
- **Profile picture**: This visually represents your personal account and is located in the personal information section, at the top when you access General in your profile space.
- **Company logo**: This allows for quick identification of your company. It is located at the very bottom of the business information section in General in your profile space.

To update your profile picture or company logo, **click on the corresponding icon in the GENERAL section** and select the desired image from your files.

:::tip ***Tips for Choosing the Right Images***
- ***Profile picture***: Choose a clear, sharp, and professional photo to represent your profile.
- ***Company logo***: Select an official, well-framed logo that respects your brand's colors and proportions.
- Ensure the file is of good resolution for optimal visibility on the platform.
- We encourage you to use [1:1] aspect ratio formats.
