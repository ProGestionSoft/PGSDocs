Logging into your account on **PRO GESTION SOFT** is designed to be fast, secure, and simple. If you are already registered, you can easily log in at `https://progestionsoft.com/login`, using your email address and password.

Here’s a detailed guide to help you through this step, as well as options in case you forget your password.

## Login step \{#step}
To access your account, follow these steps:

- Enter your **email address**: Make sure to enter the email address you used during registration. Double-check it, as even a small error may prevent you from logging in.
- Enter your **password**: The password must be the same one you set during registration. For security reasons, your password is hidden by symbols while typing to protect your information from prying eyes.
- Click the **"Login"** button: Once your credentials are entered, click the login button to submit your information. We will check if the information matches an existing account. If correct, you will be redirected to your account’s home page.

## If you forget your password \{#forgot-password}
We understand that it’s possible to forget your password. To facilitate account recovery, we have implemented a simple and secure password reset procedure. Here’s how to proceed:

- Click on **"Forgot password"** on the login page, just below the "Login" button to start the reset process.
- Enter your **email address**: A new page will open, prompting you to enter the email address associated with your account. This step is crucial as it allows us to verify your identity by sending a six (6)-digit code to a verified email address.
- Receive the **verification code**: Once your email address is submitted, we will send you an email containing a six (6)-digit code to reset your password. This code is valid for 15 minutes.
- Create a **new password**: After entering the code received by email, you will be directed to a page where you can choose a new password. Ensure that you create a strong password, following the security recommendations (at least eight characters, with uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and symbols).
- **Log in** with the new password: Once your password is reset, you can return to the login page and use your new email address and password combination to access your account.

:::tip ***Tips to ensure your account’s security***
To maintain a high level of security for your account, here are some best practices to follow:
- ***Change your password regularly***: Regularly updating your password helps limit the risks of your account being compromised.
- ***Do not share your login details***: Keep your password private and avoid sharing it with others, even those you trust.
- ***Use a password manager***: If you find it hard to remember a complex password, consider using a secure password manager to store and protect your information.
- ***Monitor suspicious logins***: If you notice any unusual activity on your account, such as logins you didn’t make, immediately contact our support team to take the necessary actions.
