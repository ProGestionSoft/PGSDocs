Registering on **PRO GESTION SOFT** is a simple yet essential process to ensure the security and authenticity of each user. It takes place at `https://progestionsoft.com/register` and is carried out in two distinct steps, aimed at gathering precise information and validating your identity.

Hereâ€™s a detailed overview of each step:

## Step 1: Entering basic information \{#step1}
In this first phase, you will be asked to provide basic information to create your account. This information includes:

- [Tax Identification Number (IFU)](/docs/intro#terminology): This number identifies the entity and is required for legal and administrative purposes.
- Company Name: This is the official name of the company or organization.
- Legal Status: This information specifies the legal type of the entity (e.g., LLC, Corporation, SAS, etc.).
- Email Address: Please enter a valid and accessible email address, as it will be the primary communication channel.

After entering this information, a six-digit verification code will be sent to the provided email address. This code is necessary to confirm that you are the owner (or an authorized administrator) of the address. This step also ensures that the email address is active and functional.

## Step 2: Validation and finalizing registration \{#step2}
Once the email is successfully verified, you can proceed to finalize your registration by providing additional information. During this step, you will be asked to enter the following:

- Phone Number: This number can be used for future communications if needed or for further verification.
- [Registration Number (RCCM)](/docs/intro#terminology): A valid registration number is required to legally identify the entity.
- Password: Choose a secure password. It must be at least eight (8) characters long and include:
    - A digit
    - A symbol
    - An uppercase letter
    - A lowercase letter

Ensure that your password meets these criteria to guarantee the security of your account and avoid any risk of compromise.
