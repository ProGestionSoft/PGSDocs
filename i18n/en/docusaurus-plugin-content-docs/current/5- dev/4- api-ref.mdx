:::warning
This documentation is incomplete and does not yet explore each resource and endpoint in detail.

We will gradually complete this section with:
- Accepted parameters.
- Possible responses with status codes (`200 OK`, `400 Bad Request`, etc.).
- Examples of requests and responses.
:::

Whether you're building a custom solution or automating processes, our API provides a powerful and flexible interface to access data and integrate our features directly into your own applications. Here's what you can do:
  - **Task automation**: Connect and automate your workflows by leveraging real-time management data.
  - **Custom integrations**: Create solutions tailored to your business needs.
  - **Centralized access**: Interact with various Pro Gestion Soft modules via a unified interface.

## Key features \{#features}

- **RESTful API**: Follows REST standards, ensuring simple and efficient integration.
- **Formats**: All requests and responses are formatted in JSON for universal integration.
- **Security**: Each call is secured with authentication tokens based on the OAuth 2.0 protocol.
- **Multi-module**: Interaction with various modules such as user management, billing, or company documents.
- **Versioning**: Adopts a stable approach with clear API versions (`v1`, `v2`, etc.).


## Getting started \{#start}

### 1. Get an API key \{#get-key}  
Log in to your **Pro Gestion Soft** account and go to the developer space to generate your API key. This key is unique and personal.

> The developer section is not fully available yet. We are still doing some security checks and will soon deploy it at a larger scale.

### 2. Test a Simple Request \{#test-requete}

You can test your first request by running the following code to retrieve your profile information:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://***.com/v1/{resource}"  
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN"
```

> We will provide more details on this section soon.

### 3. Basic Structure of a Request \{#base-structure}

Each request follows a standard structure: 

- **HTTP methods**: Use `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, or `DELETE` depending on the action.
- **URL**: Format your requests by following the structure `https://***.com/v1/{resource}`.
- **Headers**: Provide necessary information such as authentication and content type.
- **Body**: Add data in a structured JSON format for `POST` and `PUT` requests.  


## Use case \{#use-case} 

### Retrieve a list of invoices \{#get-invoices}

```bash title="GET / Invoices"
curl -X GET "https://***.com/v1/invoices"  
-H "Authorization: Bearer VOTRE_JETON_D_AUTHENTIFICATION"
```

### Create a new invoice \{#create-invoice}

```bash title="POST / Invoices"
curl -X POST "https://***.com/v1/invoices"  
-H "Authorization: Bearer VOTRE_JETON_D_AUTHENTIFICATION"  
-H "Content-Type: application/json"  
-d '{
  "client_id": "12345",
  "amount": 1000,
  "due_date": "2024-12-15"
}'
```

### Delete a user \{#delete-user}

```bash title="DELETE / Users"

```
