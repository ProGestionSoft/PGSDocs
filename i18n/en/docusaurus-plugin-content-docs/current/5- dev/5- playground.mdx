This environment has been designed to allow you to discover, test, and experiment with the features of our platform in a friendly and practical setting.

[Access the Playground](/playground) and select a specific simulator from the module you wish to explore.

## What you can do \{#guide}

You have access to interactive tools to:
1. ***Interactive editor***: Write and modify code live. Results will be displayed in real-time, allowing you to test your ideas immediately.

2. ***Preview only***: If you prefer a lighter experience, you can simply view a preview of the features without diving into the code.

3. ***Code only***: View the source code of each simulator. This can be a starting point for you to quickly begin your projects.

:::warning
We apply advanced formatting to the "Preview" simulators by default. The interactive rendering simulator supports other formats. You will need to create and integrate your custom styles, depending on the experience you wish to create.

## Precautions and code handling \{#rules}

To ensure an optimal and secure experience, we ask you to follow these guidelines:

1. ***Responsible use***: The Playground is an educational environment. Avoid running malicious code or submitting sensitive data.

2. ***Simulated data***: All data used is fictitious. Do not attempt to test real or confidential information in this space.

3. ***Code backup***: Make sure to save your codes and configurations locally before leaving the Playground. Changes made here are not saved permanently.

4. ***Browser compatibility***: For a smooth experience, we recommend using a modern and up-to-date browser.

By exploring this Playground, you will develop your skills, test your ideas, and contribute to enriching our community. Have fun and learn with peace of mind!
