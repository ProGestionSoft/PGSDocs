Welcome to the **Pro Gestion Soft** developer space! This documentation has been specially designed to help you customize and integrate our tools into your professional projects. Whether you're an integrator, analyst, or solution creator, you will find the necessary resources here to fully leverage the potential of our platform.  

In this section, we will explore key features organized to meet the diverse needs of developers:  

1. **Embedding iFrames**  
   Learn how to extract interactive and dynamic widgets from the PGS cloud library and easily integrate them into third-party websites. With these iFrames, you can enhance your user interfaces with ready-to-use features while centralizing your data.  

2. **Creating Static Sites**  
   We will show you how to design and integrate static sites directly into the PGS platform. This section details the processes for creating dynamic data visualizations, essential for making strategic decisions based on customized indicators.  

3. **API Reference**  
   Dive into our API documentation to understand how to interact with the different PGS modules (user management, billing, cloud library, etc.). You will learn how to make secure API calls, handle real-time data, and automate your workflows.  

4. **Playground**  
   Take advantage of an interactive space dedicated to testing and experimenting in real-time. The playground allows you to manipulate code, explore practical examples, and validate your integrations before implementing them.
